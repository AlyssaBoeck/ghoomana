Maps adaptable for your adventure!
When I want to go for a walk, run or bike ride, I like to plan a route I want to follow. I have used google maps, onthegomap.com, mapmyrun.com and others and although they all have very nice features that are useful on their own, I still haven't found one that does everything I want. And because I am very interested in GIS and programming I thought, why not try to build something myself? We will see how that goes.
